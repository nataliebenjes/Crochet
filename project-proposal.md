# Project Proposal Template

**Name of Student:** Natalie Benjes

**Name of Project:** Crochet e-commerce site

## Project's Purpose or Goal
The purpose of this project is to create an e-commerce website focused on crochet products. Users should be able to browse through a variety of crochet items, view product details, and add items to their shopping cart. The MVP will primarily focus on displaying products and enabling basic cart functionality. Stretch goals include integrating Stripe for secure payment processing.

## Minimum Viable Features
1. Display a catalog of crochet products with images and descriptions.
2. Allow users to view detailed information about each product.
3. Provide the functionality to add items to the shopping cart.

## Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?
I'm going to be following an online tutorial for this, and feel a bit weird about the lack of self direction for this. I feel like this project could be relevant to the workforce, but I'm not sure. Do you think that I should be building my own backend using C# instead of strapi?
